# Contributing to Beyojar

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested via storybook or unit test, add tests.
3. Ensure that eslint checks and storybook test suite passes.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

-   Let prettier and eslint to take care of the formatting
-   Please make sure to add TSDoc comments wherever necessary
-   Avoid using `any` as a type
-   Make sure that the code is easily readable and understandable

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Deployment

-   Changes to landing page will be automatically deployed to https://beyojar.com via [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
-   Mobile app changes will be manually verified before triggering a build via [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/accounts/kajendran/projects/beyojar)

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/kaje94/beyojar/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
